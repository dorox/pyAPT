pyAPT
=====

Python interface to Thorlab's APT motion controllers. Depends on `libftdi1` and
`pylibftdi`. Under Linux the easiest way to get these is to install `libftdi1`
using the package management system, and then install `pylibftdi` into a virtual
environment or equivalent.

## Modified for use with LTS150
